## List the User Stories that you will implement in this iteration.
* A grocery shopper wants to see the optimal combination of grocery orders in order to save the most money (see example in bullet point 5 above).
  * We have already developed an algorithm in iteration 3, but we need to improve it
* A grocery shopper may want the ability to share a cart with their family, friends, or roommates.

## Tasks From Iteration Four That Need To Still Be Completed:
* Optimize algorithm should show how much money was saved
* Host backend on Heroku


## New Tasks for Iteration Five
* Slide deck
* Fixing remaining bugs
* Shared carts integration with frontend
* UPC fetching from Amazon

# Retrospective for Iteration Five:
**Delivered:**
* Fixed bugs with optimize()
* Fixed bug with Walmart Fetch
* Fixed webscraping Amazon bug
* Moved to Postgresql 
* Slide deck
* Shared carts integration with frontend
* Optimize algorithm should show how much money was saved

**Semi-Delivered:**
* Host backend on Heroku (it's hosted now, but some functions don't work)

**Not Delivered:**

**Reflection:**  
Since this is the last iteration, our two biggest priorities were to fix remaining bugs and to get the backend hosted onto Heroku. Most of the previous bugs have been fixed and our backend is now hosted on Heroku, but hosting it on Heroku introduced more bugs where some of our endpoints don't work. We will fix it before the final presentation. Other than that, we finished a couple items that were from the backlog from iteration four like integrating shared carts with frontend and the optimize algorithm reporting back how much money was saved.
